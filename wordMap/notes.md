# Creating a Word Map using RiTa.js and p5.js

I want to import a word randomizer in my p5.js sketch which puts random dots on the screen. These dots would be replaced with words. The user can have an option to change word length and play with the pattern. 

## Basic Stuff

- [x] Import RiTa Library
- [x] Add Lexicon function
- [x] Add a text placeholder on the screen
- [x] Use lexicon.randomWord() in place of that text
- [x] Use this setting in a for loop
- [x] Add the previous function of placing random dots, with the ellipse replaced by this text
- [x] Change the textSize() based on the Hue values

## Customization

- [x] Create a slider to choose the number of syllables
  - [x] Add a slider.changed(function) command to change as the user slides
- [x] Create a dropdown to choose from the parts of speech: noun/ verb/ ..
  - [x] Add a slider.changed(function) command to change as the user slides
