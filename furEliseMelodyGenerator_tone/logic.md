# Creating a custom melody

## Rules

1. We are going to use the C-Major key.
2. We are going to use 4/4 time.
3. We will use only half-notes and quarter-notes.
4. Our melody will have no rests!
5. Our melody will have 4 measures.
6. These measures will have an A A B B C structure.
7. Our melody will start at a random place in the scale, and move up and down the scale in random steps.
8. Our melody should contain mostly conjunct (single) pitch steps: e.g. C to D, F to E
9. Our melody should have occasional disjunct (bigger) jumps: e.g. C to E.
10. Our melody will end on the tonic: E.
